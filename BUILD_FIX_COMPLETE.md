# 🔧 Build Error Fix - Deployment Ready

## ❌ Error Encountered

```md
Failed to compile.
./src/components/packages/ourpixo-gallery.tsx
'client-only' cannot be imported from a Server Component module. 
It should only be used from a Client Component.
The error was caused by using 'styled-jsx' in './src/components/packages/ourpixo-gallery.tsx'.
```

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File:** `src/components/packages/ourpixo-gallery.tsx`

**Change:** Added `"use client";` directive at the top of the file

### Before

```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface OurPixoGalleryProps {
  galleryUrl: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle?: string;
}
```

### After

```typescript
"use client";
import React from 'react';

interface OurPixoGalleryProps {
  galleryUrl: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle?: string;
}
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The `OurPixoGallery` component uses `styled-jsx` for styling, which requires client-side rendering. The component was being imported by package pages but didn't have the `"use client"` directive, causing Next.js to treat it as a Server Component by default.
