# Mobile Application Error - Fixed ‚úÖ

## Issue Summary

Mobile users were experiencing "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred" on pages with images (gallery, service, contact, about), while pages without images (booking) worked fine.

## Root Cause

The `OptimizedImage` component was causing compatibility issues on mobile browsers. The complex placeholder logic and image type detection was breaking on certain mobile devices.

## Solution Applied

Reverted all usage of `OptimizedImage` back to standard Next.js `Image` component while keeping the iOS-safe GSAP fixes that prevent crashes on iPhones.

## Testing Checklist

After these changes, test the following on **actual mobile devices**:

### Pages That Were Broken (Should Now Work)

- [ ] Gallery page (`/gallery`) - Should load all 18 images
- [ ] Service pages - Should display hero images
- [ ] About page (`/about`) - Should show 4 portrait images
- [ ] Contact page - Check if it uses images
- [ ] Package pages - All thumbnails should load
- [ ] Checkout page - Package image should display

### Pages That Were Already Working

- [ ] Booking page - Should continue working
- [ ] Home page - Verify no regression
- [ ] Service landing - Verify iOS-safe GSAP still works

### Button Responsiveness

- [ ] "Book Your Session" button visible and clickable on mobile
- [ ] Text is fully readable (not cut off)
- [ ] Underline animation works on tap
- [ ] Button centers properly on small screens

### iOS-Specific Testing

- ‚ùå Priority loading based on imageType
- ‚ùå Responsive sizes calculation

- ‚úÖ Automatic optimization
- ‚úÖ Responsive srcset generation
- ‚úÖ Lower bundle size (no custom component)

## Future Optimization Recommendations

If you want to improve performance later, consider these **safe** approaches:

1. **Next.js Image Config** (in `next.config.mjs`)
   - Configure image domains
   - Set image sizes
   - Enable blur placeholders for static imports

2. **Lazy Loading Strategy**
   - Use `loading="lazy"` for below-fold images
   - Use `priority` for above-fold images
   - Implement Intersection Observer for galleries

3. **Image CDN**
   - Use Cloudinary, Imgix, or similar
   - Let the CDN handle optimization
   - Don't build custom components

4. **Lighthouse Testing**
   - Run tests on mobile devices
   - Focus on LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
   - Monitor INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
