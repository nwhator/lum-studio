## Next Steps

The booking page needs to be completely rebuilt as a 3-step wizard component:

1. Create BookingWizard component with state management
2. Integrate PACKAGE_DATA for dynamic categories/pricing
3. Build payment confirmation step with click-to-copy
4. Enhance WhatsApp message formatting
5. Add comprehensive validation and error handling
6. Test URL preselection from package pages

Would you like me to proceed with creating the new comprehensive booking page?
