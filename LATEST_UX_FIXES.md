## ✅ Fix 1: About Hero Image on Mobile

**File:** `src/components/about/about-us-hero.tsx`

**Change:** Removed hybrid logic, image now shows on ALL devices (mobile + desktop)

**Result:** ✅ Consistent image experience across all screen sizes

## ✅ Fix 2: Hamburger Menu Visibility

**File:** `src/layouts/headers/header-one.tsx`

**Issue:** Hamburger existed but was invisible (transparent bars)

**Fix:**

- Added `display: block !important`
- Added `visibility: visible !important`
- Hover turns green (#B7C435)

**Result:** ✅ Hamburger clearly visible on all devices!

## ✅ Fix 3: FAQ Accordion Enhanced

**File:** `src/components/packages/package-template.tsx`

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Circular toggle icon** (30px circle with +/−)
- ✅ **Rotation animation** (90° on hover, 180° when active)
- ✅ **Question indents** on hover (28px → 32px)
- ✅ **Green color theme** (#B7C435 for active states)
- ✅ **Smooth animations** (cubic-bezier easing)
- ✅ **Rich hover feedback** (background, icon, text)
- ✅ **Active state highlighting** (green background + border)
- ✅ **Professional polish** (shadows, spacing, typography)

**Visual Flow:**
1. **Default:** White background, gray circle with "+"
2. **Hover:** Light green bg, icon turns green & rotates 90°, question indents
3. **Active:** Green theme, icon rotates 180° to "−", answer slides down smoothly
4. **Close:** Reverse animation, smooth collapse

**Result:** ✅ Professional, engaging, obvious clickability!
