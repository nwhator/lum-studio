# üö® GitHub Secret Leak - Fix Instructions

GitHub detected that `.env.local` was committed with potential secrets. Follow these steps to fix it immediately.

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do This First!)

### Step 1: Remove .env.local from Git History

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Remove .env.local from Git tracking (keeps local file)
git rm --cached .env.local

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "Remove .env.local from version control"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify .gitignore is Working

```bash
# Check that .env.local is ignored
git status

# You should NOT see .env.local listed
```

---

## üîí SECURITY CHECKLIST

### ‚úÖ What to Do Next:

1. **Change ALL passwords/secrets** that were in the committed file:
   - ‚úÖ `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Set a new secure password
   - ‚úÖ `SMTP_PASSWORD` - If you added your Gmail app password, revoke it and create new one
   - ‚úÖ Any API keys you may have added

2. **Gmail App Password (if you set one)**:
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Revoke the old app password
   - Generate a new one
   - Update in your **local** `.env.local` file (NOT committed)

3. **Verify the file is gone from GitHub**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/nwhator/lum-studio
   - Check that `.env.local` is no longer visible in the repository

---

## üìã What Got Exposed?

Based on your `.env.local` file, these were placeholders (not real secrets):
- ‚úÖ `SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com` (placeholder)
- ‚úÖ `SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here` (placeholder)
- ‚úÖ `ADMIN_PASSWORD=ChangeThisSecurePassword123!` (default placeholder)

**Good news:** These are just placeholders, not real credentials. However, you should still:
1. Remove the file from Git (commands above)
2. Set your actual credentials **locally only**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevent This in the Future

### Best Practices:

1. **Never commit `.env.local` or `.env` files**
   - Already in `.gitignore` ‚úÖ
   - File was committed before `.gitignore` was updated

2. **Use `.env.example` for templates**
   ```bash
   # Safe to commit - no real secrets
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
   ```

3. **Double-check before committing**
   ```bash
   git status  # Always review what you're committing
   ```

4. **Use environment variables on Vercel**
   - Never put real secrets in code
   - Add them in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

---

## üîß Clean Git History (Optional - Advanced)

If you want to completely remove the file from Git history (not usually necessary for placeholders):

```bash
# WARNING: This rewrites history - coordinate with team first
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.local" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push (be careful!)
git push origin --force --all
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Only do this if:**
- You committed real secrets (not just placeholders)
- You're working alone or have coordinated with your team
- You understand this rewrites Git history

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After running the removal commands:

1. **Check local Git status**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Should NOT show .env.local
   ```

2. **Check GitHub repository**
   - Visit: https://github.com/nwhator/lum-studio
   - Verify `.env.local` is not in the file list

3. **Check your local file still exists**
   ```bash
   ls -la .env.local
   # Should show the file (it's just ignored by Git now)
   ```

## üìû Need Help?

If GitHub continues to flag secrets:
1. Revoke any real credentials that were committed
2. Consider the advanced Git history cleaning above
3. Contact GitHub Support if needed

## üéØ Summary

1. ‚úÖ Run: `git rm --cached .env.local`
2. ‚úÖ Run: `git commit -m "Remove .env.local from version control"`
3. ‚úÖ Run: `git push origin main`
4. ‚úÖ Change any real passwords/secrets you may have set
5. ‚úÖ Verify `.env.local` is gone from GitHub

**Your placeholders are safe, but removing the file is still important for security best practices!**
